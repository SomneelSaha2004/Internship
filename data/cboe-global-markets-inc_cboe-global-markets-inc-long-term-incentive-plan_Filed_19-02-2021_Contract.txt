CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS, INC. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT – PERFORMANCE BASED
This Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (this “Agreement”) is dated effective _______________________(the “Award Date”), and is between Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (the “Corporation”) and _______________ (“Participant”).  Any term capitalized but not defined in this Agreement will have the meaning set forth in the Second Amended and Restated Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (formerly CBOE Holdings, Inc.) Long-Term Incentive Plan (as may be amended from time to time, the “Plan”). 
1.Award.  The Corporation hereby awards to Participant [___] Restricted Stock Units (the “Restricted Stock Units”).  The Restricted Stock Units will be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement.  Each Restricted Stock Unit is a notional amount that represents one unvested share of Stock and entitles Participant, subject to the terms of this Agreement, to receive a share of Stock if and when the Restricted Stock Unit vests.  2.No Rights as Stockholder; Dividend Equivalents.  Participant shall have no voting rights with respect to shares of Stock represented by Restricted Stock Units until the date of the issuance of the shares of Stock (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Corporation or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Corporation).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Corporation declares a cash dividend on shares of Stock, on the payment date of the dividend, Participant will be credited with Dividend Equivalent Rights equal to the amount of the cash dividend per share multiplied by the number of Restricted Stock Units held by Participant on the dividend’s record date.  The Dividend Equivalent Rights credited to Participant under the preceding sentence will be deemed to be reinvested in additional Restricted Stock Units, which will be subject to the same terms regarding vesting, forfeiture, and distribution as Restricted Stock Units awarded to Participant under this Agreement.     3.Performance Period. The Performance Period for the Restricted Stock Units shall be the three (3) year period commencing on [___] and ending on [___].4.Vesting; Effect of Termination of Service; Change in Control.  (a)Subject to Sections 4(b), 4(c) and 4(d) below, Participant’s Restricted Stock Units will vest upon the expiration of the Performance Period, subject to and contingent upon achievement of the Performance Goal described in Exhibit A hereto and Participant’s continued Service through the last day of the Performance Period.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Participant attains at least age fifty-five (55) and completes at least ten (10) years of Service (“Retirement Vesting”) and subsequently retires prior to expiration of the Performance Period, Participant shall be entitled to receive (i) the number of Restricted Stock Units that would have vested in accordance with the preceding sentence based on the level of achievement of the Performance Goal actually achieved if Participant had continued Service through the last day of the Performance Period, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the Performance Period on which Participant was providing Service, and the denominator of which is 1,095. 
​

​
(b)The Restricted Stock Units will vest at the Target level of achievement of the Performance Goal (as described in Exhibit A), upon the earlier to occur of (i) Participant’s death or (ii) Participant’s becoming Disabled, provided that such condition qualifies as “disability” as defined for purposes of Section 409A, in each case, if prior to any forfeiture event under Section 4(d) below.  
(c)This subsection 4(c) shall apply to this Agreement, this Award and any Replacement Award provided to Participant to replace this Award in lieu of Section 8.2(b) of the Plan.  Upon a termination of Participant’s Service by the Corporation or its Affiliate without Cause or by Participant for “Good Reason” (as defined below), in each case, upon or within two years after a Change in Control and prior to any forfeiture event under Section 4(d) below, this Award or any Replacement Award held by Participant shall become fully vested and free of restrictions at the Target level of achievement of the Performance Goal (as described in Exhibit A, as amended by the Replacement Award, if any), except that vesting shall be, to the extent determinable, at the level of achievement of the Performance Goal actually achieved as of the date of termination of Service (with similar performance assumed to be achieved through the remainder of the Performance Period) if greater than the Target level of achievement, and shall be distributed upon or within 60 days of such termination of Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Award or the Replacement Award, as applicable, is considered deferred compensation subject to Section 409A, payment shall be made pursuant to the Award’s original schedule if necessary to comply with Section 409A.
For purposes of this Award “Good Reason” shall be deemed to exist if, and only if, without the Participant’s express written consent:
(i)   The Corporation or its Affiliate assigns to Participant authorities, duties or responsibilities (including titles) that are inconsistent in any material and adverse respect with Participant’s immediately preceding authorities, duties or responsibilities with the Corporation or its Affiliate (including any material and adverse diminution of such immediately preceding authorities, duties or responsibilities); 
(ii)  The Corporation or its Affiliate materially reduces Participant’s base compensation;
(iii)   The Corporation or its Affiliate requires Participant to relocate his or her principal business office or principal place of residence outside the Chicago metropolitan area (or outside the immediately preceding location of Participant’s principal business office with the Corporation or its Affiliate), or assigns to Participant duties that would reasonably require such relocation;    
(iv)   The Corporation or its Affiliate materially breaches the terms of any agreement pursuant to which services are provided to the Corporation or its Affiliate by Participant; or
(v)    The Corporation or its Affiliate terminates, reduces or limits Participant’s participation in any bonus or incentive compensation arrangement relative to the level of participation of other employees of similar rank for a reason that is not reasonably related to Participant’s level of job performance and provided that such action results in a material reduction in the aggregate value of Participant’s incentive compensation below the aggregate value as of the immediately preceding bonus or incentive compensation performance period.

​
Participant’s voluntary termination of Service shall not be considered a termination of Service for Good Reason unless Participant terminates his or her Service  within 120 days after the initial existence of the condition constituting Good Reason; provided, Participant provides written notice to the Corporation or its Affiliate of Participant’s intention to resign for Good Reason, which notice specifies in reasonable detail the breach or action giving rise thereto within 90 days of its initial existence, and the Corporation or its Affiliate does not cure such breach or action within 30 days after the date of the Participant’s notice.
(d)If Participant’s Service is terminated for any reason before all of Participant’s Restricted Stock Units have vested under this Agreement (including pursuant to an event described in Section 4(b) or 4(c) above), Participant’s unvested Restricted Stock Units will be forfeited upon the effective date of such termination of Service.  Neither the Corporation nor any Affiliate will have any further obligations to Participant under this Agreement if Participant’s Restricted Stock Units are forfeited.
5.Terms and Conditions of Distribution.  (a)Distribution of a share of Stock that corresponds to a vested Restricted Stock Unit (other than a Restricted Stock Unit that vested due to Retirement Vesting) shall be made to Participant as soon as practicable after the Restricted Stock Unit vests, but not later than two and a half (2½) months after the end of the calendar year in which the Restricted Stock Unit vests. 
(b)Distribution of a share of Stock that corresponds to a Restricted Stock Unit that vested due to Retirement Vesting shall be made to Participant during the two and a half (2½) months period after the end of the calendar year in which or with which the Performance Period expired or, if earlier, as soon as practicable following the earlier to occur of the following dates: (i) the date on which such Restricted Stock Unit would otherwise have vested in accordance with Section 4(b), or (ii) Participant’s “separation from service” as defined for purposes of Section 409A (or, if Participant is a “specified employee” as defined for purposes of Section 409A on the date of such separation from service, the date that is the first day of the seventh (7th) month following Participant’s separation from service).
(c)If Participant dies before the date on which the Corporation would have distributed shares of Stock in satisfaction of vested Restricted Stock Units, the Corporation will distribute such shares of Stock to Participant’s designated beneficiary(ies) or, if none are designated or surviving, to Participant’s estate or personal representative.  The Corporation is not required to issue or deliver any shares of Stock before completing the steps necessary to comply with applicable Federal and state securities laws (including any registration requirements) and applicable stock exchange rules and practices.  The Corporation will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause compliance with those laws, rules and practices.  The foregoing provisions are subject in all cases to the requirements of Section 409A.  
6.Nontransferability.  Unvested Restricted Stock Units may not be sold, transferred, exchanged, pledged, assigned, garnished, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.  Any effort to assign or transfer the rights under this Agreement will be wholly ineffective, and will be grounds for termination by the Committee of all rights of Participant under this Agreement.​

​
TSR Percentile AttainedPercentage of Restricted Stock Units That Vest[__]th percentile (“Maximum”) or greater [___]%[__]th percentile (“Target”)[___]%[__]th percentile (“Threshold”) [___]%​
