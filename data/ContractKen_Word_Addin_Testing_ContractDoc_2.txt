ARTICLE II 

AMOUNT AND TERMS OF THE COMMITMENT 

Section 2.01    The Advances. The Liquidity Provider hereby irrevocably agrees, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to make Advances to the Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Effective Date until 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the Expiry Date (unless the obligations of the Liquidity Provider shall be earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of Section 2.04(b)) in an aggregate amount at any time outstanding not to exceed the Maximum Commitment. 

 

10 




Section 2.02    Making of Advances. (a) Each Interest Advance shall be made by the Liquidity Provider upon delivery to the Liquidity Provider of a written and completed Notice of Borrowing in substantially the form of Annex I, signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower, such Interest Advance to be in an amount not exceeding the Maximum Available Commitment at such time and used solely for the payment when due of interest with respect to the Class B Certificates at the Stated Interest Rate therefor in accordance with Section 3.05(a) and 3.05(b) of the Intercreditor Agreement. Each Interest Advance made hereunder shall automatically reduce the Maximum Available Commitment and the amount available to be borrowed hereunder by subsequent Advances by the amount of such Interest Advance (subject to reinstatement as provided in the next sentence). Upon repayment to the Liquidity Provider in full or in part of the amount of any Interest Advance made pursuant to this Section 2.02(a), together with accrued interest thereon (as provided herein), the Maximum Available Commitment shall be reinstated by an amount equal to the amount of such Interest Advance so repaid, but not to exceed the Maximum Commitment; provided, however, that the Maximum Available Commitment shall not be so reinstated at any time if (x) both a Performing Note Deficiency exists and a Liquidity Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or (y) a Final Advance, a Downgrade Advance, a Non-Extension Advance or a Special Termination Advance shall have occurred, except as provided in Section 2.06(d) with respect to a Downgrade Drawing. 

(a)    (i) A Non-Extension Advance shall be made by the Liquidity Provider in a single Borrowing if this Agreement is not extended in accordance with Section 3.05(d) of the Intercreditor Agreement unless a Replacement Liquidity Facility to replace this Agreement shall have been previously delivered to the Borrower in accordance with said Section 3.05(d), upon delivery to the Liquidity Provider of a written and completed Notice of Borrowing in substantially the form of Annex II, signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower, in an amount equal to the Maximum Available Commitment at such time, and shall be used to fund the Class B Cash Collateral Account in accordance with Sections 3.05(d) and 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement. 

(ii)    A Downgrade Advance shall be made by the Liquidity Provider in a single Borrowing upon this Liquidity Facility becoming a Downgraded Facility (as provided for in Section 3.05(c) of the Intercreditor Agreement) unless a Replacement Liquidity Facility to replace this Agreement shall have been previously delivered to the Borrower in accordance with said Section 3.05(c), upon delivery to the Liquidity Provider of a written and completed Notice of Borrowing in substantially the form of Annex III, signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower, in an amount equal to the Maximum Available Commitment at such time, and shall be used to fund the Class B Cash Collateral Account in accordance with Sections 3.05(c) and 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement. 

(b)    A Final Advance shall be made by the Liquidity Provider in a single Borrowing following the receipt by the Borrower of a Termination Notice from the Liquidity Provider pursuant to Section 6.01(a) upon delivery to the Liquidity Provider of a written and 

 

11 




completed Notice of Borrowing in substantially the form of Annex IV, signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower, in an amount equal to the Maximum Available Commitment at such time, and shall be used to fund the Class B Cash Collateral Account in accordance with Sections 3.05(f) and 3.05(i) of the Intercreditor Agreement. 

(c)    A Special Termination Advance shall be made in a single Borrowing upon the receipt by the Borrower of a Special Termination Notice from the Liquidity Provider pursuant to Section 6.01(b), by delivery to the Liquidity Provider of a written and completed Notice of Borrowing in substantially the form of Annex V, signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower, in an amount equal to the Maximum Available Commitment at such time, and shall be used to fund the Class B Cash Collateral Account in accordance with Section 3.05(f) and Section 3.05(k) of the Intercreditor Agreement. 

(d)    Each Borrowing shall be made by notice in writing (a “Notice of Borrowing”) in substantially the form required by Section 2.02(a), 2.02(b), 2.02(c) or 2.02(d), as the case may be, given by the Borrower to the Liquidity Provider. If a Notice of Borrowing is delivered by the Borrower in respect of any Borrowing no later than 12:30 p.m. (New York City time) on a Business Day, upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02 with respect to such requested Borrowing, the Liquidity Provider shall make available to the Borrower, in accordance with its payment instructions, the amount of such Borrowing in Dollars and immediately available funds, before 4:00 p.m. (New York City time) on such Business Day or before 12:30 p.m. (New York City time) on such later Business Day specified in such Notice of Borrowing. If a Notice of Borrowing is delivered by the Borrower in respect of any Borrowing after 12:30 p.m. (New York City time) on a Business Day, upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 4.02 with respect to such requested Borrowing, the Liquidity Provider shall make available to the Borrower, in accordance with its payment instructions, the amount of such Borrowing in Dollars and immediately available funds, before 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the first Business Day next following the day of receipt of such Notice of Borrowing or on such later Business Day specified by the Borrower in such Notice of Borrowing. Payments of proceeds of a Borrowing shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Borrower in accordance with such wire transfer instructions as the Borrower shall furnish from time to time to the Liquidity Provider for such purpose. Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. Each Notice of Borrowing shall be effective upon delivery of a copy thereof to the Liquidity Provider at the address and in the manner specified in Section 7.02 hereof. 

(e)    Upon the making of any Advance requested pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing in accordance with the Borrower’s payment instructions, the Liquidity Provider shall be fully discharged of its obligation hereunder with respect to such Notice of Borrowing, and the Liquidity Provider shall not thereafter be obligated to make any further Advances hereunder in respect of such Notice of Borrowing to the Borrower or to any other Person (including the Class B Trustee or any Class B Certificateholder). If the Liquidity Provider makes an Advance requested pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing before 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the second Business Day after the date of payment specified in Section 2.02(e), the Liquidity Provider shall have fully discharged its obligations hereunder with respect to such Advance and an event of default shall not have occurred hereunder. Following the making of any Advance 

 

12 




pursuant to Section 2.02(b), 2.02(c) or 2.02(d) to fund the Class B Cash Collateral Account, the Liquidity Provider shall have no interest in or rights to the Class B Cash Collateral Account, such Advance or any other amounts from time to time on deposit in the Class B Cash Collateral Account; provided that the foregoing shall not affect or impair the obligations of the Subordination Agent to make the distributions contemplated by Section 3.05(c)(v), 3.05(e) or 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement and provided, further, that the foregoing shall not affect or impair the rights of the Liquidity Provider to provide written instructions with respect to the investment and reinvestment of amounts in the Class B Cash Collateral Account to the extent the Liquidity Provider is entitled to do so pursuant to Section 2.2(b) of the Intercreditor Agreement. By paying to the Borrower proceeds of Advances requested by the Borrower in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Liquidity Provider makes no representation as to, and assumes no responsibility for, the correctness or sufficiency for any purpose of the amount of the Advances so made and requested. 

Section 2.03    Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Liquidity Provider the fees set forth in the Fee Letter. 

Section 2.04    Reduction or Termination of the Maximum Commitment. (a) Automatic Reduction. Promptly following each date on which the Required Amount is reduced as a result of a reduction in the Pool Balance of the Class B Certificates, the Maximum Commitment shall automatically be reduced to an amount equal to such reduced Required Amount (as calculated by the Borrower). The Borrower shall give notice of any such automatic reduction of the Maximum Commitment to the Liquidity Provider and the Airlines within two Business Days thereof. The failure by the Borrower to furnish any such notice shall not affect any such automatic reduction of the Maximum Commitment. 

(a)    Termination. Upon the making of any Provider Advance or Special Termination Advance or the making of or conversion to a Final Advance hereunder or the occurrence of the Termination Date, the obligation of the Liquidity Provider to make further Advances hereunder shall automatically and irrevocably terminate, and the Borrower shall not be entitled to request any further Borrowing hereunder, except in the case of a Downgrade Advance, as provided in Section 2.06(d). 

Section 2.05    Repayments of Interest Advances, the Special Termination Advance or the Final Advance. Subject to Sections 2.06, 2.07 and 2.09 hereof, the Borrower hereby agrees, without notice of an Advance or demand for repayment from the Liquidity Provider (which notice and demand are hereby waived by the Borrower), to pay, or to cause to be paid, to the Liquidity Provider (a) on each date on which the Liquidity Provider shall make an Interest Advance, the Special Termination Advance or the Final Advance, an amount equal to the amount of such Advance (any such Advance, until repaid, is referred to herein as an “Unpaid Advance”), plus (b) interest on the amount of each such Unpaid Advance in the amounts and on the dates determined as provided in Section 3.07; provided that if (i) the Liquidity Provider shall make a Provider Advance at any time after making one or more Interest Advances which shall not have been repaid in accordance with this Section 2.05 or (ii) this Liquidity Facility shall become a Downgraded Facility or Non-Extended Facility at any time when unreimbursed Interest Advances have reduced the Maximum Available Commitment to zero, then such Interest 

 

13 




Advances shall cease to constitute Unpaid Advances and shall be deemed to have been changed into an Applied Downgrade Advance or an Applied Non-Extension Advance, as the case may be, for all purposes of this Agreement (including, without limitation, for the purpose of determining when such Interest Advance is required to be repaid to the Liquidity Provider in accordance with Section 2.06 and for the purposes of Section 2.06(b)); provided, further, that amounts in respect of a Special Termination Advance withdrawn from the Class B Cash Collateral Account for the purpose of paying interest on the Class B Certificates in accordance with Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement (the portion of the outstanding Special Termination Advance equal to the amount of any such withdrawal, but not in excess of the outstanding Special Termination Advance, being an “Applied Special Termination Advance”) shall thereafter (subject to Section 2.06(b)) be treated as an Interest Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon; provided, further, that if, following the making of a Special Termination Advance, the Liquidity Provider delivers a Termination Notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.01(a), such Special Termination Advance (including any portion thereof that is an Applied Special Termination Advance) shall thereafter be treated as a Final Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon; and, provided, further, that if, after making a Provider Advance, the Liquidity Provider delivers a Special Termination Notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.01(b), any Unapplied Provider Advance shall be converted to and treated as a Special Termination Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon and the obligation for repayment thereof under the Intercreditor Agreement. The Borrower and the Liquidity Provider agree that the repayment in full of each Interest Advance, Special Termination Advance and Final Advance on the date such Advance is made is intended to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the Borrower by the Liquidity Provider. For the avoidance of doubt, interest payable on an Interest Advance, Special Termination Advance or the Final Advance shall not be regarded as overdue unless such interest is not paid when due under Section 3.07. 

Section 2.06    Repayments of Provider Advances. (a) Amounts advanced hereunder in respect of a Provider Advance shall be deposited in the Class B Cash Collateral Account and invested and withdrawn from the Class B Cash Collateral Account as set forth in Sections 3.05(c), 3.05(d), 3.05(e) and 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement. Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower agrees to pay to the Liquidity Provider, on each Regular Distribution Date, commencing on the first Regular Distribution Date after the making of a Provider Advance, interest on the principal amount of any such Provider Advance, in the amounts determined as provided in Section 3.07; provided, however, that amounts in respect of a Provider Advance withdrawn from the Class B Cash Collateral Account for the purpose of paying interest on the Class B Certificates in accordance with Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement (the amount of any such withdrawal being (y), in the case of a Downgrade Advance, an “Applied Downgrade Advance” and (z) in the case of a Non-Extension Advance, an “Applied Non-Extension Advance” and together with an Applied Downgrade Advance, an “Applied Provider Advance”) shall thereafter (subject to Section 2.06(b)) be treated as an Interest Advance under this Agreement for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon; provided, further, however, that if, following the making of a Provider Advance, the Liquidity Provider delivers a Termination Notice to the Borrower pursuant to Section 6.01(a), such Provider Advance shall thereafter be treated as a Final Advance under this Agreement for 

 

14 




purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon. Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, immediately upon the withdrawal of any amounts from the Class B Cash Collateral Account on account of a reduction in the Required Amount, the Borrower shall repay to the Liquidity Provider a portion of the Provider Advances in a principal amount equal to such reduction, plus interest on the principal amount so repaid as provided in Section 3.07. 

(a)    At any time when an Applied Provider Advance or Applied Special Termination Advance (or any portion thereof) is outstanding, upon the deposit in the Class B Cash Collateral Account of any amount pursuant to clause “fourth” of Section 3.02 of the Intercreditor Agreement (any such amount being a “Replenishment Amount”) for the purpose of replenishing or increasing the balance thereof up to the Required Amount at such time, (i) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Applied Provider Advances and Applied Special Termination Advances (and of Provider Advances and Special Termination Advances treated as Interest Advances for purposes of determining the Applicable Liquidity Rate for interest payable thereon) shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such Replenishment Amount, and (ii) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all Unapplied Provider Advances shall be automatically increased by the amount of such Replenishment Amount. 

(b)    Upon the provision of a Replacement Liquidity Facility in replacement of this Agreement in accordance with Section 3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement, as provided in Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement, amounts remaining on deposit in the Class B Cash Collateral Account after giving effect to any Applied Provider Advance or Applied Special Termination Advance on the date of such replacement shall be reimbursed to the Liquidity Provider, but only to the extent such amounts are necessary to repay in full to the Liquidity Provider all amounts owing to it hereunder. 

(c)    If, at any time after making a Downgrade Advance, the Liquidity Provider satisfies the Threshold Rating and delivers written notice to that effect to the Borrower and the Airlines, as of the second Business Day following receipt of such notice, (i) this Liquidity Facility shall cease to be a Downgraded Facility, (ii) any Unapplied Downgrade Advance shall be withdrawn from the Class B Cash Collateral Account and reimbursed to the Liquidity Provider, (iii) any Applied Downgrade Advance shall be converted to an Interest Advance, (iv) the Maximum Available Commitment shall be reinstated by an amount equal to the amount of such Unapplied Downgrade Advance so reimbursed, but not to exceed the Maximum Commitment, and the obligation of the Liquidity Provider to make Advances shall be reinstated in an equal amount, (v) the Borrower shall be entitled to request Borrowings and (vi) the proviso in the definition of Maximum Available Commitment and clause (y) of the proviso in the final sentence of Section 2.02(a) shall, in each case, no longer apply to such Downgrade Advance. 

Section 2.07    Payments to the Liquidity Provider Under the Intercreditor Agreement. In order to provide for payment or repayment to the Liquidity Provider of any amounts hereunder, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that amounts available and referred to in Articles II and III of the Intercreditor Agreement, to the extent payable to the Liquidity Provider pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement), shall be paid to the Liquidity Provider in accordance with the terms thereof (but, for the avoidance of doubt, without duplication of or increase in any amounts 

 

15 




payable hereunder). Amounts so paid to the Liquidity Provider shall be applied by the Liquidity Provider in the order of priority required by the applicable provisions of Articles II and III of the Intercreditor Agreement and shall discharge in full the corresponding obligations of the Borrower hereunder. 

Section 2.08    Book Entries. The Liquidity Provider shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower resulting from Advances made from time to time and the amounts of principal and interest payable hereunder and paid from time to time in respect thereof; provided, however, that the failure by the Liquidity Provider to maintain such account or accounts shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower in respect of Advances. 

Section 2.09    Payments from Available Funds Only. All payments to be made by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be made only from the amounts that constitute Scheduled Payments, Special Payments and other payments under the Operative Agreements, including payment under Section 4.02 of the Participation Agreements and payments under Section 2.14 of the Indentures, and only to the extent that the Borrower shall have sufficient income or proceeds therefrom to enable the Borrower to make payments in accordance with the terms hereof after giving effect to the priority of payments provisions set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Liquidity Provider agrees that it will look solely to such amounts to the extent available for distribution to it as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement and this Agreement and that the Borrower, in its individual capacity, is not personally liable to it for any amounts payable or liability under this Agreement except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Participation Agreement. Amounts on deposit in the Class B Cash Collateral Account shall be available to the Borrower to make payments under this Agreement only to the extent and for the purposes expressly contemplated in Section 3.05(f) of the Intercreditor Agreement. 

Section 2.10    Extension of the Expiry Date; Non-Extension Advance. If the Liquidity Provider notifies the Borrower and the Airlines in writing before the 60th day prior to any anniversary date of the Closing Date that occurs prior to the 15th day after the Final Legal Distribution Date for the Class B Certificates (such notice, a “Non-Extension Notice”) that its obligations to make Advances hereunder shall not be extended beyond the immediately following anniversary date of the Closing Date (and if the Liquidity Provider shall not have been replaced in accordance with Section 3.05(e) of the 

Intercreditor Agreement), the Borrower shall be entitled on and after the 25th day prior to such anniversary date (but prior to such anniversary date and in any event prior to the then applicable Expiry Date) to request a Non-Extension Advance in accordance with Section 2.02(b)(i) hereof and Section 3.05(d) of the Intercreditor Agreement. 

ARTICLE III 

OBLIGATIONS OF THE BORROWER 

Section 3.01    Increased Costs. Without duplication of any rights created by Section 3.03, if as a result of any Regulatory Change there shall be any increase by an amount reasonably 

 

16 




deemed by the Liquidity Provider to be material in the actual cost to the Liquidity Provider of making, funding or maintaining any Advances or its obligation to make any such Advances or there shall be any reduction by an amount reasonably deemed by the Liquidity Provider to be material in the amount receivable by the Liquidity Provider under this Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement in respect thereof, and in case of either such an increase or reduction, such event does not arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Liquidity Provider, from its breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein or in the Intercreditor Agreement or from its failure to comply with any such Regulatory Change (any such increase or reduction being referred to herein as an “Increased Cost”), then, subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower shall from time to time pay to the Liquidity Provider an amount equal to such Increased Cost within 10 Business Days after delivery to the Borrower and the Airlines of a certificate of an officer of the Liquidity Provider describing in reasonable detail the event by reason of which it claims such Increased Cost and the basis for the determination of the amount of such Increased Cost; provided that the Borrower shall be obligated to pay amounts only with respect to any Increased Costs accruing from the date 120 days prior to the date of delivery of such certificate. Such certificate, in the absence of manifest error, shall be considered prima facie evidence of the amount of the Increased Costs for purposes of this Agreement; provided that any determinations and allocations by the Liquidity Provider of the effect of any Regulatory Change on the costs of maintaining the Advances or the obligation to make Advances are made on a reasonable basis. For the avoidance of doubt, the Liquidity Provider shall not be entitled to assert any claim under this Section 3.01 in respect of or attributable to Excluded Taxes. The Liquidity Provider will notify the Borrower and the Airlines as promptly as practicable of any event occurring after the date of this Agreement that will entitle the Liquidity Provider to compensation under this Section 3.01. The Liquidity Provider agrees to investigate all commercially reasonable alternatives for reducing any Increased Costs and to use all commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or minimize, to the greatest extent possible, any claim in respect of Increased Costs, including, without limitation, by designating a different Lending Office, if such designation or other action would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such claim; provided that the foregoing shall not obligate the Liquidity Provider to take any action that would, in its reasonable judgment, cause the Liquidity Provider to take any action that is not materially consistent with its internal policies or is otherwise materially disadvantageous to the Liquidity Provider or that would cause the Liquidity Provider to incur any material loss or cost, unless the Borrower or the Airlines agree to reimburse or indemnify the Liquidity Provider therefor. If no such designation or other action is effected, or, if effected, such notice fails to avoid the need for any claim in respect of Increased Costs, the Airlines may arrange for a Replacement Liquidity Facility in accordance with Section 3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, in no event shall the Borrower be required to make payments under this Section 3.01: (a) in respect of any Regulatory Change proposed by any applicable governmental authority (including any branch of a legislature), central bank or comparable agency of the United States or the Liquidity Provider’s jurisdiction of organization or in which its Lending Office is located and pending as of the date of this Agreement (it being agreed that the Regulatory Changes contemplated by (i) the frameworks published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision entitled “Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems” dated December 2010 (revised June 2011) and “Basel III: 

 

17 




The Liquidity Coverage Ratio and liquidity risk monitoring tools,” dated January 2013 and (ii) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in connection therewith, shall not be considered to have been proposed or pending as of the date of this Agreement); (b) if a claim hereunder in respect of an Increased Cost arises through circumstances peculiar to the Liquidity Provider and that do not affect similarly organized commercial banking institutions in the same jurisdiction generally that are in compliance with the law, rule, regulation or interpretation giving rise to the Regulatory Change relating to such Increased Cost; (c) if the Liquidity Provider shall fail to comply with its obligations under this Section 3.01 or (d) if the Liquidity Provider is not also seeking payment for similar increased costs in other similarly situated transactions related to the airline industry. 

Section 3.02    Reserved. 

Section 3.03    Withholding Taxes. (a) All payments made by the Borrower under this Agreement shall be made without deduction or withholding for or on account of any Taxes, unless such deduction or withholding is required by law. If any Taxes are so required to be withheld or deducted from any amounts payable to the Liquidity Provider under this Agreement, then, subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower shall pay to the relevant authorities the full amount so required to be deducted or withheld and, without duplication of any rights created by Section 3.01, if such Taxes are Covered Taxes, pay to the Liquidity Provider such additional amounts as shall be necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by the Liquidity Provider (after deduction or withholding of all Covered Taxes) shall be equal to the full amount that would have been received by the Liquidity Provider had no withholding or deduction of Covered Taxes been required. If any Covered Taxes for which the Borrower is obligated to pay any additional amounts to the Liquidity Provider pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence were required by law to be withheld and were not withheld and deposited with the relevant authorities on a timely basis, the Borrower shall, after written demand from the Liquidity Provider therefor describing in reasonable detail the subject of such demand, promptly pay to the Liquidity Provider such additional amounts equal to the amount of any such Covered Taxes asserted directly against the Liquidity Provider as a result of such failure to withhold, together with any related penalties and interest. Within 30 days after the date of any such payment by the Borrower to the relevant authorities, the Borrower shall furnish to the Liquidity Provider the original or a certified copy of (or other documentary evidence of) the payment of the Taxes applicable to such payment. The Liquidity Provider agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts (consistent with applicable legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office if making such change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such additional amounts that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of the Liquidity Provider, be otherwise materially disadvantageous to the Liquidity Provider. 

If the Liquidity Provider receives a refund of any Taxes for which additional amounts were paid by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 3.03, the Liquidity Provider shall pay to the Borrower (for deposit into the Collection Account) the amount of such refund (and any interest thereon), net of all related out-of-pocket expenses. The Borrower, upon the request of the Liquidity Provider, shall repay to the Liquidity Provider the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental or 

 

18 




taxing authority) in the event that the Liquidity Provider is required to repay such refund to such governmental or taxing authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, in no event will the Liquidity Provider be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph the payment of which would place the Liquidity Provider in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the Liquidity Provider would have been in if the Tax subject to payment of additional amounts and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Liquidity Provider to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 

The Liquidity Provider will (i) provide (on its behalf and on behalf of any participant holding a Participation pursuant to Section 7.08) to the Borrower (x) on or prior to the Effective Date two valid completed and executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI (whichever is applicable), including thereon a valid U.S. taxpayer identification number (or, with respect to any such participant, such other form or documentation as may be applicable) covering all amounts receivable by it in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements and (y) thereafter from time to time such additional forms or documentation as may be necessary to establish an available exemption from withholding of United States Tax on payments hereunder so that such forms or documentation are effective for all periods during which it is the Liquidity Provider and (ii) provide timely notice to the Borrower if any such form or documentation is or becomes inaccurate. The Liquidity Provider shall deliver to the Borrower such other forms or documents as may be reasonably requested by the Borrower or required by applicable law to establish that payments hereunder are exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of Covered Taxes. 

(a)    All payments (including, without limitation, Advances) made by the Liquidity Provider under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of, and without reduction for or on account of, any Taxes. If any Taxes are required to be withheld or deducted from any amounts payable to the Borrower under this Agreement, the Liquidity Provider shall (i) within the time prescribed therefor by applicable law pay to the appropriate governmental or taxing authority the full amount of any such Taxes (and any additional Taxes in respect of the additional amounts payable under clause (ii) hereof) and make such reports or returns in connection therewith at the time or times and in the manner prescribed by applicable law, and (ii) pay to the Borrower an additional amount which (after deduction of all such Taxes) will be sufficient to yield to the Borrower the full amount which would have been received by it had no such withholding or deduction been made. Within 30 days after the date of each payment hereunder, the Liquidity Provider shall furnish to the Borrower the original or a certified copy of (or other documentary evidence of) the payment of the Taxes applicable to such payment. 

On or before the Closing Date, the Borrower shall provide the Liquidity Provider with its fully executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, evidencing a complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax and backup withholding. If any exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, any Taxes required to be borne by the Liquidity Provider under this Section 3.03(b) is reasonably available to the Borrower without providing any information regarding the holders or beneficial owners of the Certificates, the Borrower shall deliver the Liquidity Provider such form 

 

19 




or forms and such other evidence of the eligibility of the Borrower for such exemption or reductions (but without any requirement to provide any information regarding the holders or beneficial owners of the Certificates) as the Liquidity Provider may reasonably identify to the Borrower as being required as a condition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, such Taxes. 

(b)    If a payment made hereunder to the Liquidity Provider would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if the Liquidity Provider were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirement of FATCA (including without limitation those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), the Liquidity Provider shall deliver to the Borrower at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower as may be necessary for the Borrower to comply with the Borrower’s obligations under FATCA and to determine whether the Liquidity Provider has complied with the Liquidity Provider’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this paragraph, “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 

Section 3.04    Payments. Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower shall make or cause to be made each payment to the Liquidity Provider under this Agreement so as to cause the same to be received by the Liquidity Provider not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the day when due. The Borrower shall make all such payments in Dollars, to the Liquidity Provider in immediately available funds, by wire transfer to the account of Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, acting through its New York Branch, at Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, N.A., ABA [***], Account No.: [***], Account Name: [***], Attention: [***], Reference to: Alaska 2020-1B EETC; or to such other U.S. bank account as the Liquidity Provider may from time to time direct the Subordination Agent. 

Section 3.05    Computations. All computations of interest based on the Base Rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the LIBOR Rate shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable. 

Section 3.06    Payment on Non-Business Days. Whenever any payment to be made hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and no additional interest shall be due as a result (and if so made, shall be deemed to have been made when due). If any payment in respect of interest on an Advance is so deferred to the next succeeding Business Day, such deferral shall not delay the commencement of the next Interest Period for such Advance (if such Advance is a LIBOR Advance) or reduce the number of days for which interest will be payable on such Advance on the next Interest Payment Date for such Advance.

Section 3.07    Interest. (a) Subject to Sections 2.07 and 2.09, the Borrower shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, without duplication, interest on (i) the unpaid principal amount of each Advance from and including the date of such Advance (or, in the case of an Applied Provider Advance or Applied Special Termination Advance, from and including the date on which the amount thereof was withdrawn from the Class B Cash Collateral Account to pay interest on the Class B Certificates) to but excluding the date such principal amount shall be paid in full (or, in the case of an Applied Provider Advance or Applied Special Termination Advance, the date on which the Class B Cash Collateral Account is fully replenished in respect of such Advance) and (ii), to the extent permitted by law, any other amount due hereunder (whether fees, commissions, expenses or other amounts or installments of interest on Advances or any such other amount) that is not paid when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) from and including the due date thereof to but excluding the date such amount is paid in full, in each such case, at the interest rate per annum for each day that such amount remains overdue and unpaid equal to the Applicable Liquidity Rate for such Advance or such other amount, as the case may be, as in effect for such day, but in no event in any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above at a rate per annum greater than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law; provided, however, that, if at any time the otherwise applicable interest rate as set forth in this Section 3.07 shall exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, then to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law any subsequent reduction in such interest rate will not reduce the rate of interest payable pursuant to this Section 3.07 below the maximum rate permitted by applicable law until the total amount of interest accrued equals the absolute amount of interest that would have accrued (without additional interest thereon) if such otherwise applicable interest rate as set forth in this Section 3.07 had at all relevant times been in effect. 

(a)    Each Advance (other than a Provider Advance or a Special Termination Advance) will be a Base Rate Advance for the period from the date of its Borrowing to (but excluding) the third Business Day following the Liquidity Provider’s receipt of the Notice of Borrowing for such Advance. Thereafter, such Advance shall be a LIBOR Advance, and an Applied Provider Advance and an Applied Special Termination Advance shall be a LIBOR Advance from the date of its withdrawal from the Class B Cash Collateral Account unless the Borrower elects otherwise. 

(b)    Each LIBOR Advance shall bear interest during each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin for such LIBOR Advance, payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period and, in the event of the payment of principal of such LIBOR Advance on a day other than such last day, on the date of such payment (to the extent of interest accrued on the amount of principal repaid). 

(c)    Each Base Rate Advance shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for such Base Rate Advance, payable in arrears on each Regular Distribution Date and, in the event of the payment of principal of such Base Rate Advance on a day other than a Regular Distribution Date, on the date of such payment (to the extent of interest accrued on the amount of principal repaid). 

(d)    Each outstanding Unapplied Non-Extension Advance, Unapplied Downgrade Advance or Unapplied Special Termination Advance (each, an “Unapplied 

 

21 




Advance”), as the case may be, shall bear interest, payable in arrears on each Regular Distribution Date, in an amount equal to (i) the Investment Earnings on the amounts on deposit in the Class B Cash Collateral Account on account of such Unapplied Advance during the period beginning on the later of the date of deposit of such Unapplied Advance and the preceding Regular Distribution Date and ending on the last day prior to such Regular Distribution Date, plus (ii) an amount equal to interest at the Applicable Margin on the amount of such Unapplied Advance during such period. 

(e)    Each amount not paid when due hereunder (whether fees, commissions, expenses or other amounts or installments of interest on Advances but excluding Advances) shall bear interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus 2.0% per annum until paid. 

(f)    If at any time, the Liquidity Provider shall have determined (which determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower, absent manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the relevant interbank lending market generally (other than a Benchmark Replacement Event), the LIBOR Rate determined or to be determined for the next succeeding Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Liquidity Provider (as conclusively certified by the Liquidity Provider, absent manifest error) of making or maintaining Advances, the Liquidity Provider shall give facsimile or telephonic notice thereof (a “Rate Determination Notice”) to the Borrower and the Airlines. If such notice is given, then the outstanding principal amount of the LIBOR Advances shall be converted to Base Rate Advances effective from the date of the Rate Determination Notice; provided that the Applicable Liquidity Rate in respect of such Base Rate Advances shall be increased by one percent (1.00%). The Liquidity Provider shall withdraw a Rate Determination Notice given hereunder when the Liquidity Provider determines that the circumstances giving rise to such Rate Determination Notice no longer apply to the Liquidity Provider, and the Base Rate Advances shall be converted to LIBOR Advances effective as of the first day of the next succeeding Interest Period after the date of such withdrawal. 

(g)    Each change in the Base Rate shall become effective immediately. The rates of interest specified in this Section 3.07 with respect to any Advance or other amount shall be referred to as the “Applicable Liquidity Rate”. 

Section 3.08    Replacement of Borrower. Subject to Section 5.02, from time to time and subject to the successor Borrower’s meeting the eligibility requirements set forth in Section 6.09 of the Intercreditor Agreement applicable to the Subordination Agent, upon the effective date and time specified in a written and completed Notice of Replacement Subordination Agent in substantially the form of Annex VIII (a “Notice of Replacement Subordination Agent”) delivered to the Liquidity Provider by the then Borrower, the successor Borrower designated therein shall become the Borrower for all purposes hereunder. 

Section 3.09    Funding Loss Indemnification. The Borrower shall pay to the Liquidity Provider, upon the request of the Liquidity Provider, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of the Liquidity Provider) to compensate it for any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or redeployment of deposits or other funds 

 

22 




acquired by the Liquidity Provider to fund or maintain any LIBOR Advance (but excluding loss of the Applicable Margin or anticipated profits) incurred as a result of: 

(1)    Any repayment of a LIBOR Advance on a date other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance; or 

(2)    Any failure by the Borrower to borrow a LIBOR Advance on the date for borrowing specified in the relevant notice under Section 2.02. 

Section 3.10    Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, if any change in any law, rule or regulation applicable to or binding on the Liquidity Provider, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by the Liquidity Provider with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency shall make it unlawful or impossible for the Liquidity Provider to maintain or fund its LIBOR Advances, then upon notice to the Borrower and the Airlines by the Liquidity Provider, the outstanding principal amount of the LIBOR Advances shall be converted to Base Rate Advances (a) immediately upon demand of the Liquidity Provider, if such change or compliance with such request, in the reasonable judgment of the Liquidity Provider, requires immediate conversion; or (b) at the expiration of the last Interest Period to expire before the effective date of any such change or request. The Liquidity Provider will notify the Borrower and the Airlines as promptly as practicable of any event that will or to its knowledge is reasonably likely to lead to the conversion of LIBOR Advances to Base Rate Advances under this Section 3.10; provided that a failure by the Liquidity Provider to notify the Borrower or the Airlines of an event that is reasonably likely to lead to such a conversion prior to the time that it is determined that such event will lead to such a conversion shall not prejudice the rights of the Liquidity Provider under this Section 3.10. The Liquidity Provider agrees to investigate all commercially reasonable alternatives for avoiding the need for such conversion, including, without limitation, designating a different Lending Office, if such designation or other action would avoid the need to convert such LIBOR Advances to Base Rate Advances; provided that the foregoing shall not obligate the Liquidity Provider to take any action that would, in its reasonable judgment, cause the Liquidity Provider to incur any material loss or cost, unless the Borrower or the Airlines agree to reimburse or indemnify the Liquidity Provider therefor. If no such designation or other action is effected, or, if effected, fails to avoid the need for conversion of the LIBOR Advances to Base Rate Advances, the Airlines may arrange for a Replacement Liquidity Facility in accordance with Section 3.05(e) of the Intercreditor Agreement.

Section 7.03    No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of the Liquidity Provider to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right.

28 




transferee in connection therewith; (ii) the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of documents, or of any endorsement thereon, even if such documents should prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; or (iii) the making of Advances by the Liquidity Provider against delivery of a Notice of Borrowing and other documents which do not comply with the terms hereof; provided, however, that the Borrower shall have a claim against the Liquidity Provider, and the Liquidity Provider shall be liable to the Borrower, to the extent of any damages suffered by the Borrower that were the result of (A) the Liquidity Provider’s willful misconduct or gross negligence in determining whether documents presented hereunder comply with the terms hereof or (B) any breach by the Liquidity Provider of any of the terms of this Agreement or the Intercreditor Agreement, including, but not limited to, the Liquidity Provider’s failure to make lawful payment hereunder after the delivery to it by the Borrower of a Notice of Borrowing complying with the terms and conditions hereof. In no event, however, shall the Liquidity Provider be liable on any theory of liability for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (including, without limitation, loss of profits, business or anticipated savings). 

(a)    Neither the Liquidity Provider nor any of its officers, employees or directors or affiliates shall be liable or responsible in any respect for (i) any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in connection with this Agreement or any Notice of Borrowing delivered hereunder or (ii) any action, inaction or omission which may be taken by it in good faith, absent willful misconduct or gross negligence (in which event the extent of the Liquidity Provider’s potential liability to the Borrower shall be limited as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph), in connection with this Agreement or any Notice of Borrowing.

In addition, the Borrower shall pay any and all recording, stamp and other similar Taxes and fees payable or determined to be payable in the United States in connection with the execution, delivery, filing and recording of this Agreement, any other Operative Agreement and such other documents, and agrees to save the Liquidity Provider harmless from and against any and all liabilities with respect to or resulting from any delay in paying or omission to pay such Taxes or fees. 

 

29 




Section 7.08    Binding Effect; Participations. (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower and the Liquidity Provider and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except that neither the Liquidity Provider (except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.08) nor (except as contemplated by Section 3.08) the Borrower shall have the right to assign, pledge or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein, subject to the Liquidity Provider’s right to grant Participations pursuant to Section 7.08(b). 

(a)    The Liquidity Provider agrees that it will not grant any participation (including, without limitation, a “risk participation”) (any such participation, a “Participation”) in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations hereunder or under the other Operative Agreements, unless all of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) such Participation is to a Permitted Transferee, (ii) such Participation is made in accordance with all applicable laws, including, without limitation, the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, any laws or regulations imposing U.S. economic sanctions measures or any orders or licenses issued thereunder and any other applicable laws relating to the transfer of similar interests and (iii) such Participation shall not be made under circumstances that require registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or qualification of any indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. Notwithstanding any such Participation, the Liquidity Provider agrees that (1) the Liquidity Provider’s obligations under the Operative Agreements shall remain unchanged, and such participant shall have no rights or benefits as against the Parent, the Airlines or the Borrower or under any Operative Agreement, (2) the Liquidity Provider shall remain solely responsible to the other parties to the Operative Agreements for the performance of such obligations, (3) the Liquidity Provider shall remain the maker of any Advances, and the other parties to the Operative Agreements shall continue to deal solely and directly with the Liquidity Provider in connection with the Advances and the Liquidity Provider’s rights and obligations under the Operative Agreements, (4) the Liquidity Provider shall be solely responsible for any withholding Taxes or any filing or reporting requirements relating to such Participation and shall hold the Borrower, the Parent and the Airlines and their respective successors, permitted assigns, affiliates, agents and servants harmless against the same and (5) none of the Parent, the Airlines or the Borrower shall be required to pay to the Liquidity Provider any amount under Section 3.01 or Section 3.03 greater than it would have been required to pay had there not been any grant of a Participation by the Liquidity Provider. The Liquidity Provider may, in connection with any Participation or proposed Participation pursuant to this Section 7.08(b), disclose to the participant or proposed participant any information relating to the Operative Agreements or to the parties thereto furnished to the Liquidity Provider thereunder or in connection therewith and permitted to be disclosed by the Liquidity Provider; provided, however, that prior to any such disclosure, the participant or proposed participant shall agree in writing for the express benefit of the Borrower and the Airlines to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential information included therein (subject to customary exceptions). 

The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the Liquidity Provider’s source of funds may derive in part from its participants. Accordingly, in determining amounts due by the Borrower to the Liquidity Provider pursuant to Section 3.01 and Section 3.03 of this Agreement, references in this Agreement to determinations, reserve, liquidity and capital adequacy 

 

30 




requirements, increased costs, reduced receipts, additional amounts due pursuant to Section 3.03 as they pertain to the Liquidity Provider shall be deemed also to include those of each of its participants that are commercial banking institutions and of whose participation the Borrower has been notified, in each case up to the maximum amount that would have been incurred by or attributable to the Liquidity Provider directly had there not been any grant of a Participation by the Liquidity Provider, and references to the Liquidity Provider therein and in related definitions shall be treated as references to such participants where applicable; provided that in any event, none of the Parent, the Airlines or the Borrower shall be required to pay any amount under Section 3.01 or Section 3.03 greater than it would have been required to pay had there not been any grant of a Participation by the Liquidity Provider. 

The Liquidity Provider shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participant’s interest under this Agreement (the “Participant Register”); provided that the Liquidity Provider shall not have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any participant or any information relating to a participant’s interest in any commitments, loans or its other obligations) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Liquidity Provider shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such Participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. 

(b)    Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 7.08, the Liquidity Provider may assign and pledge all or any portion of the Advances owing to it to any Federal Reserve Bank or the United States Treasury as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and any Operating Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank; provided that any payment in respect of such assigned Advances made by the Borrower to the Liquidity Provider in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall satisfy the Borrower’s obligations hereunder in respect of such assigned Advance to the extent of such payment. No such assignment shall release the Liquidity Provider from its obligations hereunder. 

Section 7.09    Severability. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. 

Section 7.10    Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN DELIVERED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, INCLUDING ALL MATTERS OF CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND PERFORMANCE.
