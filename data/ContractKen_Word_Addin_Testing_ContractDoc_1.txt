(b) The Offering Shareholder shall give written notice (the “Offering Shareholder Notice”) to the Company and the Trident Shareholders stating its bona fide intention to Transfer the Offered Shares and specifying the number of Offered Shares and the material terms and conditions, including the price, pursuant to which the Offering Shareholder proposes to Transfer the Offered Shares. The Offering Shareholder Notice shall constitute the Offering Shareholder’s offer to Transfer the Offered Shares to the Trident Shareholders, which offer shall be irrevocable for a period of 20 Business Days (the “ROFO Notice Period”).

(c) By delivering the Offering Shareholder Notice, the Offering Shareholder represents and warrants to the Company and the Trident Shareholders that: (i) the Offering Shareholder has full right, title and interest in and to the Offered Shares; (ii) the Offering Shareholder has all the necessary power and authority and has taken all necessary action to Transfer such Offered Shares as contemplated by this Section 3.02; and (iii) the Offered Shares are free and clear of any and all Liens other than those arising as a result of or under the terms of this Agreement.

(d) Upon receipt of the Offering Shareholder Notice, the Trident Shareholders shall have until the end of the ROFO Notice Period to elect to purchase any amount of the Offered Shares by delivering a written notice (a “ROFO Notice”) to the Offering Shareholder and the Company stating that it agrees to purchase such specified amount of Offered Shares on the terms specified in the Offering Shareholder Notice. Any ROFO Notice shall be binding upon delivery and irrevocable by the Trident Shareholders. 

(e) If the Trident Shareholders do not deliver a ROFO Notice during the ROFO Notice Period, then the Trident Shareholders shall be deemed to have waived all of their rights to purchase the Offered Shares under this Section 3.02. 

(f) If the Trident Shareholders do not deliver a ROFO Notice, the Offering Shareholder may, during the 180-day period immediately following the expiration of the ROFO Notice Period, which period may be extended for a reasonable time not to exceed 270 days to the extent reasonably necessary to obtain any Government Approvals (the “Waived ROFO Transfer Period”), and subject to the provisions of Section 3.04, Transfer all of the Offered Shares to a Third Party Purchaser on terms and conditions no more favorable to the Third Party Purchaser than those set forth in the Offering Shareholder Notice. If the Offering Shareholder does not consummate the Transfer of the Offered Shares within the Waived ROFO Transfer Period, the rights provided hereunder shall be deemed to be revived and the Offered Shares shall not be offered or sold to any Person unless first re-offered to the Trident Shareholders in accordance with this Section 3.02.

(g) Each Shareholder shall take all actions as may be reasonably necessary to consummate any Transfer contemplated by this Section 3.02, including entering into agreements and delivering certificates and instruments and consents as may be deemed necessary or appropriate.

(h) At the closing of any Transfer pursuant to this Section 3.02, the Offering Shareholder shall deliver to the Trident Shareholders the certificate or certificates representing the Offered Shares to be sold (if any), accompanied by stock powers and all necessary stock transfer taxes paid and stamps affixed, if necessary, against receipt of the purchase price therefor from the Trident Shareholders by certified or official bank check or by wire transfer of immediately available funds. 

(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.02, the Atrium Nominee shall be permitted to Transfer Common Shares to the Company or the Company’s designee in connection with any Leaver Sale without complying with the terms of this Section 3.02.

(j) The provisions of this Section 3.02 shall not apply to a Transfer to the Company (or as the Company may direct) pursuant to a scheme approved by the Board for the return of income or capital to Shareholders.

Section 3.03 Drag-along Rights.

(a) If at any time the Trident Shareholders (together with their Permitted Transferees) hold no less than 55% of the aggregate number of outstanding Common Shares of the Company held by the Initial Shareholders at such time and the Trident Shareholders are proposing (A) a sale to one or more Third Party Purchasers of a majority of the outstanding Common Shares of the Company, (B) to approve any merger, amalgamation, or consolidation of the Company with or into one or more Third Party Purchasers, or (C) to approve any sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets to one or more Third Party Purchasers, including in each case any transaction that would constitute a Change of Control (each, a “Drag-along Sale”), the Trident Shareholders shall have the right to require that each other Shareholder (each, a “Drag-along Shareholder”) participate in such Transfer in the manner set forth in this Section 3.03; provided, however, that no Drag-along Shareholder (other than Atrium Nominee) shall be required to participate in the Drag-along Sale if the consideration for the Drag-along Sale is other than cash or registered securities listed on an established U.S. or foreign securities exchange; provided, further that, notwithstanding the preceding proviso, if such consideration is not cash or registered securities listed on an established U.S. or foreign securities exchange, the Trident Shareholders shall be entitled to effect a Drag-Along Sale as long as the Dowling Shareholders and the Enstar Shareholder are given the option, in lieu of the same form and amount of consideration per Common Share to be received by the Trident Shareholders in such Drag-Along Sale, to elect to receive the same amount of consideration per Common Share as the Trident Shareholders but solely in the form of cash consideration equal to the fair market value of the consideration that would otherwise have been received absent such election, as mutually agreed by the Trident Shareholders and any Drag-along Shareholder making such election or, if no such agreement is reached, as determined by a mutually acceptable independent appraiser that shall determine the fair market value following its review of such information, analyses and calculations as the Trident Shareholders and any such Drag-along Shareholder deems relevant, without any discount for illiquidity or minority interest. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Drag-along Shareholder shall vote in favor of the transaction and take all actions to waive any dissenters, appraisal or other similar rights.

(b) The Trident Shareholders shall exercise their rights pursuant to this Section 3.03 by delivering a written notice (the “Drag-along Notice”) to the Company and each Dragalong Shareholder no later than 20 days prior to the closing date of such Drag-along Sale. The Drag-along Notice shall make reference to the Trident Shareholders’ rights and obligations hereunder and shall describe in reasonable detail:

(i) the number of Common Shares to be sold by the Trident Shareholders, if the Drag-along Sale is structured as a Transfer of Common Shares;

(ii) the identity of the Third Party Purchaser;

(iii) the proposed date, time and location of the closing of the Drag-along Sale;



10

10



(iv) the per share purchase price and the other material terms and conditions of the Transfer, including a description of any non-cash consideration in sufficient detail to permit the valuation thereof; and

(v) a copy of any form of agreement proposed to be executed in connection therewith.

(c) If the Drag-along Sale is structured as a Transfer of Common Shares, then, subject to Section 3.03(d), each Drag-along Shareholder shall Transfer the number of shares equal to the product of (x) the number of Common Shares held by such Dragalong Shareholder and (y) a fraction (A) the numerator of which is equal to the number of Common Shares the Trident Shareholders propose to sell or transfer in the aggregate in the Drag-along Sale and (B) the denominator of which is equal to the number of Common Shares then held by the Trident Shareholders.

(d) The consideration to be received by a Drag-along Shareholder shall be the same form and amount of consideration per share of Common Shares to be received by the Trident Shareholders (or, if the Trident Shareholders are given an option as to the form and amount of consideration to be received, the same option shall be given) and the terms and conditions of such Transfer shall, except as otherwise provided in the immediately succeeding sentence, be the same as those upon which the Trident Shareholders Transfers their Common Shares. Each Drag-along Shareholder shall make or provide the same representations, warranties, covenants, indemnities and agreements as the Trident Shareholders make or provide in connection with the Dragalong Sale (except that in the case of representations, warranties, covenants, indemnities and agreements pertaining specifically to the Trident Shareholders, the Drag-along Shareholder shall make the comparable representations, warranties, covenants, indemnities and agreements pertaining specifically to itself); provided that all representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities shall be made by the Trident Shareholders and each Drag-along Shareholder severally and not jointly and any indemnification obligation shall be pro rata based on the consideration received by the Trident Shareholders and each Drag-along Shareholder, in each case in an amount not to exceed the aggregate proceeds received by the Trident Shareholders and each such Dragalong Shareholder in connection with the Drag-along Sale.

(e) The fees and expenses of the Trident Shareholders incurred in connection with a Drag-along Sale and for the benefit of all Shareholders (it being understood that costs incurred by or on behalf of the Trident Shareholders for their sole benefit will not be considered to be for the benefit of all Shareholders), to the extent not paid or reimbursed by the Company or the Third Party Purchaser, shall be shared by all the Shareholders on a pro rata basis, based on the aggregate consideration received by each Shareholder; provided that no Shareholder shall be obligated to make or reimburse any out-of-pocket expenditure prior to the consummation of the Drag-along Sale.

(f) Each Shareholder shall take all actions as may be reasonably necessary to consummate the Drag-along Sale, including entering into agreements and delivering certificates and instruments, in each case consistent with the agreements being entered into and the certificates being delivered by the Trident Shareholders.

(g) The Trident Shareholders shall have 180 days following the date of the Drag-along Notice in which to consummate the Drag-along Sale, on the terms set forth in the Drag-along Notice (which such 180-day period may be extended for a reasonable time not to exceed 270 days to the extent reasonably necessary to obtain any Government Approvals). If at the end of such period, the Trident Shareholders have not completed the Drag-along Sale, the Trident Shareholders may not then effect a transaction subject to this Section 3.03 without again fully complying with the provisions of this Section 3.03.

Section 3.04 Tag-along Rights.

(a) If at any time a Shareholder (the “Selling Shareholder”) proposes to Transfer any of its Common Shares to a Third Party Purchaser (the “Proposed Transferee”), such Selling Shareholder (and if the Selling Shareholder is a Trident Shareholder and the Trident Shareholders cannot or have not elected to exercise their rights to effect a Drag-along Sale in accordance with Section 3.03), each other 



11

11



Shareholder (other than the Atrium Nominee) (each, a “Tag-along Shareholder”) shall be permitted to participate in such Transfer (a “Tag-along Sale”) on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 3.04.

(b) Prior to the consummation of any such Transfer of Common Shares described in Section 3.04(a), and after satisfying its obligations (if any) pursuant to Section 3.02, the Selling Shareholder shall deliver to the Company and each other Shareholder a written notice (a “Sale Notice”) of the proposed Tag-along Sale subject to this Section 3.04 no later than 20 Business Days prior to the closing date of the Tag-along Sale. The Sale Notice shall make reference to the Tag-along Shareholders’ rights hereunder and shall describe in reasonable detail:

(i) the aggregate number of Common Shares the Proposed Transferee has offered to purchase;

(ii) the identity of the Proposed Transferee;

(iii) the proposed date, time and location of the closing of the Tag-along Sale;

(iv) the per share purchase price and the other material terms and conditions of the Transfer, including a description of any non-cash consideration in sufficient detail to permit the valuation thereof; and

(v) a copy of any form of agreement proposed to be executed in connection therewith.

(c) Each Tag-along Shareholder shall exercise its right to participate in a Transfer of Common Shares by the Selling Shareholder subject to this Section 3.04 by delivering to the Selling Shareholder and the Company a written notice (a “Tag-along Notice”) stating its election to do so and specifying the number of Common Shares to be Transferred by it no later than five Business Days after receipt of the Sale Notice (the “Tag-along Period”). If there are no Tag-along Shareholders or if all of the Tag-along Shareholders deliver to the Selling Shareholder and the Company Tag-along Notices with respect to all of the Common Shares held by such Tag-along Shareholders, then the Company shall deliver a notice to the Atrium Nominee within three Business Days of the end of the Tag-along Period notifying the Atrium Nominee of that fact whereupon the Atrium Nominee shall be entitled to elect to participate in such Tag-along Sale under this Section 3.04 alongside the other Shareholders in respect of all of the Common Shares held by it (but not part only thereof) by delivering to the Selling Shareholder and the Company a written notice (a “Atrium Nominee Tag Notice”) within five Business Days after the end of the Tag-along Period stating its election to do so (and in which case references hereafter to “Tag-along Shareholder(s)” shall be construed to include the Atrium Nominee accordingly). The offer of each Tag-along Shareholder set forth in a Tag-along Notice (or an Atrium Nominee Tag Notice, as applicable) shall be irrevocable, and, to the extent such offer is accepted, such Tag-along Shareholder shall be bound and obligated to Transfer in the proposed Transfer on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 3.04. The Selling Shareholder and each Tag-along Shareholder shall have the right to Transfer in a Transfer subject to this Section 3.04 the number of Common Shares equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of Common Shares the Proposed Transferee proposes to buy as stated in the Sale Notice and (y) a fraction (A) the numerator of which is equal to the number of Common Shares then held by the Selling Shareholder or such Tag-along Shareholder, as the case may be, and (B) the denominator of which is equal to the number of shares then held by the Selling Shareholder and each Tag-along Shareholder.

(d) Each Tag-along Shareholder that does not deliver a Tag-along Notice (or an Atrium Nominee Tag Notice, as applicable) in compliance with Section 3.04(c) above shall be deemed to have waived all of such Tag-along Shareholder’s rights to participate in such Transfer, and the Selling Shareholder shall (subject to the rights of any participating Tag-along Shareholder) thereafter be free to Transfer to the Proposed Transferee its Common Shares at a per share price that is no greater than the per share price set forth Manual edit in the Sale Notice and on other terms and conditions which are not materially more favorable to the Selling Shareholder than those set forth in the Sale Notice without any further obligation to the non-accepting Tag-along Shareholders.



12

12



(e) Each Tag-along Shareholder participating in a Transfer pursuant to this Section 3.04 shall receive the same consideration per share as the Selling Shareholder after deduction of such Tag-along Shareholder’s proportionate share of the related expenses in accordance with Section 3.04(g) below.

(f) Each Tag-along Shareholder shall make or provide the same representations, warranties, covenants, indemnities and agreements as the Selling Shareholder makes or provides in connection with the Tag-along Sale (except that in the case of representations, warranties, covenants, indemnities and agreements pertaining specifically to the Selling Shareholder, the Tag-along Shareholder shall make the comparable representations, warranties, covenants, indemnities and agreements pertaining specifically to itself); provided that all representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities shall be made by the Selling Shareholder and each Tag-along Shareholder severally and not jointly and any indemnification obligation in respect of breaches of representations and warranties shall be pro rata based on the consideration received by the Selling Shareholder and each Tag-along Shareholder, in each case in an amount not to exceed the aggregate proceeds received by the Selling Shareholder and each such Tag-along Shareholder in connection with any Tag-along Sale.

(g) The fees and expenses of the Selling Shareholder incurred in connection with a Tag-along Sale and for the benefit of all Shareholders (it being understood that costs incurred by or on behalf of the Selling Shareholder for its sole benefit will not be considered to be for the benefit of all Shareholders), to the extent not paid or reimbursed by the Company or the Proposed Transferee, shall be shared by all the Shareholders participating in the Tag-along Sale on a pro rata basis, based on the aggregate consideration received by each such Shareholder; provided that no Shareholder shall be obligated to make or reimburse any out-of-pocket expenditure prior to the consummation of the Tag-along Sale.

(h) Each Tag-along Shareholder shall take all actions as may be reasonably necessary to consummate the Tag-along Sale, including entering into agreements and delivering certificates and instruments, in each case consistent with the agreements being entered into and the certificates being delivered by the Selling Shareholder.

(i) The Selling Shareholder shall have 180 days following the expiration of the Tag-along Period in which to Transfer the Common Shares described in the Sale Notice, on the terms set forth in the Sale Notice (which such 180-day period may be extended for a reasonable time not to exceed 270 days to the extent reasonably necessary to obtain any Government Approvals). If at the end of such period, the Selling Shareholder has not completed such Transfer, the Selling Shareholder may not then effect a Transfer of Common Shares subject to this Section 3.04 without again fully complying with the provisions of this Section 3.04.

(j) If the Selling Shareholder Transfers to the Proposed Transferee any of its Common Shares in breach of this Section 3.04, then each Tag-along Shareholder shall have the right to Transfer to the Selling Shareholder, and the Selling Shareholder undertakes to purchase from each Tag-along Shareholder, the number of Common Shares that such Tag-along Shareholder would have had the right to Transfer to the Proposed Transferee pursuant to this Section 3.04, for a per share amount and form of consideration and upon the terms and conditions on which the Proposed Transferee bought such Common Shares from the Selling Shareholder, but without indemnity being granted by any Tag-along Shareholder to the Selling Shareholder; provided that nothing contained in this Section 3.04 shall preclude any Shareholder from seeking alternative remedies against such Selling Shareholder as a result of its breach of this Section 3.04.

(k) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.04, the Atrium Nominee shall be permitted to Transfer Common Shares to the Company or the Company’s designee in connection with any Leaver Sale without complying with the terms of this Section 3.04.

Article 4 

Pre-Emptive Rights and Other Agreements

Section 4.01 Pre-emptive Rights.



13

13



(a) The Company hereby grants to each Shareholder (other than the Atrium Nominee and the Dowling Shareholders) (each, a “Pre-emptive Shareholder”) the right to purchase its pro rata portion of any new Common Shares (other than any Excluded Securities) (the “New Securities”) that the Company may from time to time propose to issue or sell to any Person.

(b) The Company shall give written notice (an “Issuance Notice”) of any proposed issuance or sale described in subsection (a) above to the Pre-emptive Shareholders within five Business Days following any meeting of the Board at which any such issuance or sale is approved. The Issuance Notice shall set forth the material terms and conditions of the proposed issuance or sale, including:

(i) the number of New Securities proposed to be issued or sold and the percentage of the Company’s outstanding Common Shares, on a fully diluted basis, that such issuance or sale would represent;

(ii) the proposed issuance or sale date, which shall be at least 15 Business Days from the date of the Issuance Notice; and

(iii) the proposed purchase price per share.

(c) Each Pre-emptive Shareholder shall for a period of 10 Business Days following the receipt of an Issuance Notice (the “Exercise Period”) have the right to elect irrevocably to purchase, at the purchase price set forth in the Issuance Notice, up to the amount of New Securities equal to the product of (x) the total number of New Securities to be issued or sold by the Company on the issuance or sale date (as the case may be) and (y) a fraction determined by dividing (A) the number of Common Shares owned by such Pre-emptive Shareholder immediately prior to such issuance or sale by (B) the total number of Common Shares owned by all Pre-emptive Shareholders on such date immediately prior to such issuance or sale (the “Pre-emptive Pro Rata Portion”) by delivering a written notice to the Company. Such Pre-emptive Shareholder’s election to purchase New Securities shall be binding and irrevocable.

(d) No later than five Business Days following the expiration of the Exercise Period, the Company shall notify each Pre-emptive Shareholder in writing of the number of New Securities that each Pre-emptive Shareholder has agreed to purchase (including, for the avoidance of doubt, where such number is zero) (the “Over-allotment Notice”). Each Pre-emptive Shareholder exercising its right to purchase its Pre-emptive Pro Rata Portion of the New Securities in full (an “Exercising Shareholder”) shall have a right of over-allotment such that if any other Pre-emptive Shareholder fails to exercise its right under this Section 4.01 to purchase its Pre-emptive Pro Rata Portion of the New Securities (each, a “Non-Exercising Shareholder”), such Exercising Shareholder may purchase all or any portion of such Non-Exercising Shareholder’s allotment (the “Overallotment New Securities”) by giving written notice to the Company (within five Business Days of receipt of the Over-allotment Notice (the “Over-allotment Exercise Period”)) setting forth the number of Overallotment New Securities that such Exercising Shareholder is willing to purchase. Such Exercising Shareholder’s election to purchase Over-allotment New Securities shall be binding and irrevocable. If more than one Exercising Shareholder elects to exercise its right of over-allotment, each Exercising Shareholder shall have the right to purchase the number of Over-allotment New Securities it elected to purchase in its written notice; provided that if the over-allotment New Securities are over-subscribed, each Exercising Shareholder shall purchase its pro rata portion of the available Over-allotment New Securities based upon the relative Preemptive Pro Rata Portions of the Exercising Shareholders.

(e) The Company shall be free to complete the proposed issuance or sale of New Securities described in the Issuance Notice with respect to any New Securities not elected to be purchased pursuant to Section 4.01(c) and Section 4.01(d) above in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Issuance Notice (except that the amount of New Securities to be issued or sold by the Company may be reduced) so long as such issuance or sale is closed within 180 days after the expiration of the Overallotment Exercise Period (subject to the extension of such 180-day period for a reasonable time not to exceed 270 days to the extent reasonably necessary to obtain any Government Approvals). In the event the Company has not issued or sold such New Securities within such time period, the Company shall not 



14

14



thereafter issue or sell any New Securities without first again offering such securities to the Pre-emptive Shareholders in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 4.01.

(f) Upon the consummation of the issuance or sale of any New Securities in accordance with this Section 4.01, the Company shall deliver to each Exercising Shareholder certificates (if any) evidencing the New Securities, which New Securities shall be issued free and clear of any Liens (other than those arising hereunder or under Applicable Law and those attributable to the actions of the purchasers thereof), and the Company shall so represent and warrant to the purchasers thereof, and further represent and warrant to such purchasers that such New Securities shall be, upon issuance thereof to the Exercising Shareholders and after payment therefor, duly authorized and validly issued. Each Exercising Shareholder shall deliver to the Company the purchase price for the New Securities purchased by it by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Each party to the purchase and sale of New Securities shall take all such other actions as may be reasonably necessary to consummate the purchase and sale including entering into such additional agreements as may be necessary or appropriate. 

(g) If the Board determines in good faith that circumstances require the Company to issue or sell the New Securities to the Trident Shareholders or their respective Affiliates, the Company shall be permitted to issue or sell such New Securities to such Trident Shareholders and/or their respective Affiliates without complying with the Issuance Notice and related provisions set forth above, provided that as promptly as reasonably practicable following such issuance or sale, the Company permits each Pre-Emptive Shareholder having rights under this Section 4.01 to purchase such Pre-Emptive Right Shareholder’s proportionate amount of such New Securities in the manner contemplated by this Section 4.01. 

Section 4.02 Corporate Opportunities. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or under Applicable Law to the contrary (to the full extent permitted by Applicable Law), (i) each of the Trident Shareholders, the Enstar Shareholder and the Dowling Shareholders and their respective Affiliates (A) may engage in or possess an interest in other business ventures of any nature and description (whether similar or dissimilar to the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), independently or with others, and none of the Company, any Subsidiary, any other Shareholder, and each of their respective Affiliates, shall have any right by virtue of this Agreement in or to any such investment or interest of the Trident Shareholders, the Enstar Shareholder, the Dowling Shareholders, any Director and any of its or their respective Affiliates to any income or profits derived therefrom, and the pursuit of any such venture shall not be deemed wrongful or improper, and (B) shall not be obligated to present any investment opportunity to the Company or any Subsidiary even if such opportunity is of a character that, if presented to the Company or any Subsidiary, could be taken by the Company or such Subsidiary, and (ii) the parties hereby waive (and the Company shall cause the Subsidiaries to waive) to the fullest extent permitted by law any fiduciary or other duty of the Trident Shareholders, the Enstar Shareholder, the Dowling Shareholders and the Directors not expressly set forth in this Agreement, including fiduciary or other duties that may be related to or associated with self-dealing, corporate opportunities or otherwise, in each case so long as such Person acts in a manner consistent with this Agreement.

Section 4.03 Confidentiality.

(a) Each party shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, keep confidential and not divulge any information (including all budgets, business plans and analyses) concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries, including their assets, business, operations, financial condition or prospects (“Information”), and to use, and cause its Representatives to use, such Information only in connection with the operation of the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided that nothing herein shall prevent any party from disclosing such Information (i) upon the order of any court or administrative agency, (ii) upon the request or demand of any regulatory agency or authority having jurisdiction over such party, (iii) to the extent compelled by legal process or required or requested pursuant to subpoena, interrogatories or other discovery requests, to the extent necessary in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder, (v) to the other parties, (vi) to such party’s Representatives that in the reasonable judgment of such party need to know such Information or (vii) to any potential Permitted Transferee in connection with a proposed Transfer of

Common Shares from such party as long as such transferee agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Section 4.03 as if a party; provided, further, that in the case of clause (i), (ii) or (iii), such party shall notify the other parties of the proposed disclosure as far in advance of such disclosure as practicable and use reasonable efforts to ensure that any Information so disclosed is accorded confidential treatment, when and if available.

(b) The restrictions of Section 4.03(a) shall not apply to information that (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by a party or any of its Representatives in violation of this Agreement; (ii) is or becomes available to a party or any of its Representatives on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure to the receiving party and any of its Representatives, is or has been independently developed or conceived by such party without use of the Company’s or any of its Subsidiaries’ Information or (iii) becomes available to the receiving party or any of its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any other party or any of their respective Representatives; provided that such source is not known by the recipient of the information to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with the disclosing party or any of its Representatives. Furthermore, Section 4.03(a) shall not restrict (a) the Enstar Shareholder and its Affiliates from disclosing any Information required to be disclosed under applicable securities laws or the rules of any stock exchange upon which their securities are traded, and (b) the Trident Shareholders and their Affiliates from disclosing any Information to its and their respective partners (general or limited), members, stockholders, prospective investors, lenders or financing sources, in each case, in the ordinary course of business, or any prospective purchaser of its Common Shares.

Section 4.04 Registration Rights. Upon the request of any Initial Shareholder in connection with a contemplated public offering of the equity of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Company shall enter into (or shall cause the applicable Subsidiary to enter into) a registration rights agreement with the Initial Shareholders containing customary provisions for a transaction of that type, provided, however, (a) in the case of the Trident Shareholders, such registration rights agreement shall include demand registration rights and piggyback registration rights customary for a transaction of this type, and (b) in the case of the Enstar Shareholder, such registration rights agreement shall include piggyback registration rights but exclude demand registration rights, and, in each case, any piggyback rights shall include ratable cutbacks, if necessary, regardless of the piggyback party.

Section 4.05 Indemnification; Insurance. In addition to any other indemnification rights any Directors have pursuant to the memorandum of association or bye-laws of the Company and any agreement with the Company, each Director shall have the right to enter into, and the Company agrees to enter into, an indemnification agreement with each such Director, which indemnification agreement shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company. The Company shall maintain director and officer insurance covering the Directors containing terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to the Company. 

Section 4.06 Distribution of Proceeds Upon Sale of All or Substantially All Assets. To the extent the Company sells all or substantially all of its assets in a transaction to a Third Party Purchaser and does not dissolve within 90 days thereafter, subject to Applicable Law, the Company shall thereafter promptly dividend the aggregate proceeds from such transaction (net of any expenses incurred by the Company in connection with such transaction and net of any liabilities retained by the Company after giving effect to such transaction as determined in good faith by the Board) to each Shareholder, subject to the terms of any Plans, in accordance with Section 15 of the Bye-laws. 

Section 4.07 “Market Stand-off” Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Shareholder that owns beneficially at least five percent (5%) of the outstanding Common Shares at the time of any public offering by the Company of its Common Shares shall agree that during the period beginning seven (7) days before and ending (x) one hundred eighty (180) days (subject to any customary “booster shot” extensions) in the event of an Initial Public Offering or such shorter period if permitted by the managing underwriter or underwriters or (y) ninety (90) days (subject to any customary “booster shot” extensions) in the event of any other underwritten offering other than an Initial Public Offering after the date of the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with such underwritten offering, such Shareholder or its Permitted Transferees shall not, to the extent requested by the Company or the Trident 



16

16



Shareholders and/or any underwriter, if applicable, (i) offer for sale, sell, pledge, or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction or device that is designed to, or could be expected to, result in the disposition by any person at any time in the future of) any Common Shares (including Common Shares that may be deemed to be beneficially owned by such Shareholder in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities Exchange Commission and Common Shares that may be issued upon exercise of any convertible into or exchangeable securities) or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Shares, (ii) enter into any swap or other derivatives transaction that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic benefits or risks of ownership of Common Shares, whether any such transaction described in clause (i) or (ii) above is to be settled by delivery of Common Shares, in cash or otherwise, (iii) make any demand for or exercise any right or cause to be filed a registration statement, including any amendments thereto, with respect to the registration of any Common Shares or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Shares or (iv) publicly disclose the intention to do any of the foregoing; provided, that the Trident Shareholders are bound by and have entered into similar agreements; and provided further, that if the Trident Shareholders agree to such restrictions for any shorter period than prescribed above, then each other Shareholder shall only be obligated as provided in this Section 4.07 for such shorter period.
